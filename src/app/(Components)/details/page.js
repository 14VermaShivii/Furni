                        <h2><b>1. Determine what you want to know</b></h2><br />
                        <h5><b> i. Meditation:</b>  The Mayo Clinic states that<b> <u>regular meditation</u> </b>can help you feel calm and manage your emotions. <br />If you can’t access a meditation training center, find<b> <u>guided meditations</u> </b>online or via streaming platforms to start.</h5>
                        <br />
                        <h5><b>ii.Time management skills:</b> Developing your <b><u>time management skills</u></b>  means you’ll better meet deadlines and <br />accomplish your goals. Try using an online or physical planner to prioritize tasks and block out time for each item. </h5>
                        <br />
                        <h5><b>iii.Public speaking skills: </b>Delivering a speech or business presentation <b><u>gives most people the jitters.</u></b> That’s why <b><u>Toastmasters International,</u></b> an organization that helps people improve their public speaking skills, is so popular.<br /> You can also find free public speaking resources online or practice with your friends, asking for <b><u>constructive feedback</u></b> to ensure you know how to improve. </h5>

                        <br />

                        <h2><b>2. Set goals</b></h2><br />
                        <h5>Once you know what you want to learn, chart the necessary steps to reach your goals. Make sure you create <br /><b><u> SMART goals</u></b> — specific, measurable, attainable, realistic, and timely — to increase your chance of success. <br />And divide larger objectives into small items to <b><u>maintain your motivation</u></b> and avoid <b><u>feeling overwhelmed</u></b>.</h5><br />
                        <h5>If you’re not sure about the steps necessary to master a skill, speak to your instructor or other students. They can <br />help you establish realistic milestones and provide encouragement on your journey.</h5>
